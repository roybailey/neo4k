# neok4-api framework

This module contains the main Neo4j service interface and adaptor implementations.

As of Neo4j v4 not all apoc procedures are included in the maven jar, apoc-<version>-core.jar,
instead you need to incude the apoc-<version>-all.jar which you can only get from the release page on GitHub.

https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/releases[neo4j-apoc-procedures]

Hence when upgrading Neo4j you will need to download this jar and place it in the `lib` folder.
