# Example SpringBoot Application using Neo4k to support GraphQL service

* Launch `http://localhost:5000/graphiql` for GraphQL query browser
* Launch `http://localhost:5000/voyager` for GraphQL voyager visualisation of schema
* See `graphql.adoc` for samples of queries you can play with in the GraphQL query application
* See `cypher.adoc` for samples of queries you can play with in the neo4j browser

## Notes

* The following error when loading the context is because the SprintBootTest needs to run with `WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT`
